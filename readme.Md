# Custom Video Player

This project showcases a custom-built video player implemented with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It extends beyond the initial task of creating a video speed controller by incorporating a full suite of playback controls, enhancing user interaction and providing a comprehensive viewing experience.

## Features

- **Play/Pause**: Toggle playback with the play/pause button or by clicking directly on the video.
- **Forward/Backward Buttons**: Easily navigate through the video by 10 seconds.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of playback progress that allows seeking to different points within the video.
- **Playback Speed Control**: Adjust the video playback speed from 0.5x to 2x via a settings menu.
- **Full Screen Mode**: Switch between full screen and windowed mode for immersive viewing.
- **Volume Control**: Includes a mute/unmute functionality, with future plans to implement a volume slider.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
